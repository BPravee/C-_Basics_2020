Configuration Files available only for Executable Components - (App.config)


A.exe - App.config -> A.exe.config
B.exe - App.config -> B.exe.config
C.exe - App.config -> C.exe.config

Deploy(Folder)
	A.exe + A.exe.config
	B.exe

Assembly Binding Options

	1.Early Binding (Static Binding)
	2.Late Binding  (Dynamic Binding)

Early Binding
	RefererAssembly				
		Compiler would like to know Metadata of ReferencedAssembly
	TypeSafe ensured by compiler



Program - Object Oriented Program

Execution -> Procedure By Procedure

"Program Execution" -> Thread-> "Encapsulate executable instruction in the form of method"
				"Define Task for thread"
				"task->method"
				"entrypoint for execution"
			Thread -> Once thread finishes its execution path , it must return to its 
				  origin
				main()->a()->b()->c()
			Thread -> to remember execution path - uses GPS (stack data Structure)

static int x=10 (context - data)

(context- method)
static void Method(){

}


Fusion  : How to resolve referenced Assembly

			Depends : is referenced assembly is a strong name Assembly ?
					No :- Search Path
						 App Directory
						    SubDirectory (Name = ReferencedAssembly Name)
						Private Assembly depolyment
						example : 
						 AppDeploy
							App.exe
							ConsoleGreeterLib.dll (private Assembly)

Assigment 2:

Build Calculator.dll (add,sub,mul,div)
Build Excel.exe , Tally.exe 
EarlyBinding
Deploy Excel and Tally Application (diffrent folders)
	
	ExcelApp		TallyApp
	  Excel.exe			Tally.exe
